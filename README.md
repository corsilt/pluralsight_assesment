## Cory Bilyeu's Submission for take home Pluralsight assesment
### *Note that the .ipynb is too large to render because I used pandas profiling for EDA within the notebook.*
### *Also note that some resolution is lost in the .html version, so the visualizations don't look quite as good as the originals*
### Please follow this link to render an .html version of the notebook
